# Installing

There are two ways to install BeipMU, either the Microsoft Store( https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH4TRSV ), or to manually unzip one of the releases posted here.

The store version writes it's settings to a hidden and sandboxed %APPDATA% folder (so apps can't mess with each other). The non store version will write it's settings to %APPDATA%\BeipMU, but if it finds a Config.txt in it's startup location it will write it back to the same location.
