# Installing

There are two ways to install BeipMU, either the Microsoft Store( https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH4TRSV ), or to manually unzip one of the releases posted here.

The store version writes it's settings to a hidden and sandboxed %APPDATA% folder (so apps can't mess with each other). The non store version will write it's settings to %APPDATA%\BeipMU, but if it finds a Config.txt in it's startup location it will write it back to the same location.

# Upgrading

The store version auto updates (based on your OS settings)

For the github version, if your user settings are stored in %appdata%/BeipMU (the automatic default) then just replace the folder you unzipped BeipMU into with the new version's unzipped folder. If you manually put your config.txt inside the BeipMU.exe program folder, simply be sure to move or copy it to the new version's folder.
