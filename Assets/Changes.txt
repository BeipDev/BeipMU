4.00.295 - 2020-2-28

Maps, load/save/edit maps in a new map window. Lots of features! Options->'Show Map Window' to check it out
Added system menu option "Don't dock while moving" for dockable windows.
Fixed '/exit' command, previously it'd just crash at exit
Fixed glitch where a saved stats window would randomly change background colors on restart

4.00.294 - 2020-2-20

Added 'Clear' Edit menu item for edit windows
Added Tab Colors for Puppets
Added 'Delay between lines (seconds)' for Smart Paste sends
Changed Log file picker to remember the file extension after closing it
Changed puppets to not see the Connected/Disconnected messages as it'd cause activity in their windows that wasn't useful
Switched to PCRE 10.34 (from PCRE 8.x, exe grew by about 100k so hopefully regexes works a lot better!)
Fixed Logging->'Starting from Top of Window' to be more reliable, as it was previously using the 'mouse cursor over' code to work.
Fixed a glitch where right clicking in the input window/char notes/editor pane causes the window to scroll and selection to change
Fixed a glitch when docking windows larger than the available space. Now they shrink down to fit
Fixed hang/crash bug with the find dialog that happens if you have a 'New Content' marker visible, the output window is at maximum, and new text comes in
Fixed a hang when || is in a regex (probably mid edit due to preview). 'a||b' is seen as 'a or nothing or b' and the nothing results in an infinite loop of nothing matches.

4.00.293 - 2020-1-1

Added '/ansireset' command to reset the current ansi state
Fixed a docking layout restore bug, where horizontal windows could shift slightly
Fixed a crash when using Find in the main output window

4.00.292 - 2020-1-1

Added 'Set Background Color' option to stat windows
Added Logging->'Starting From Top of Window...' menu item to start a log from anywhere in the output history
Changed tab colors to be saved per character, not per tab visible at shutdown (behavior with puppets might be weird, let me know what it should do)
Fixed spawn tab triggers to now honor the "Don't show as activity" setting
Fixed a bug in smart paste where it was adding an extra line feed per line, resulting in LF CR LF sequences instead of the correct CR LF.
Fixed the tiny drag image in the Worlds dialog, same issue that the trigger/macros/aliases had when dragging an image, forgot to fix this one too
Fixed a hang when sending enormous blocks of text (>64K) and using restore logs (if what is sent is larger than the restore log size it would get stuck trying to make room forever)

Added 'Only process child triggers during capture' to spawn triggers (very useful for things like WHO lists)
Added 'Force IPv4' host address lookup to server pane
Fixed bug where rearranging tabbed spawns causes activity notifications to be on the wrong tab

Added auto scrolling of the trigger/aliases/macros views when dragging above/below the tree
Improved Stat triggers to that \1 \2, etc.. works in the window title field
Fixed drag image not appearing while dragging triggers/aliases/macros. Before fix it only worked on certain fonts/OSes (using OS function to draw them too)
Fixed an issue with mouse wheel scrolling in a split text window, where it'd scroll by the wrong amount (bug was that the scrollbar wasn't updating properly)
Fixed the keyboard macro dialog to not show typed letters unless it's replacing the key
Fixed a minor annoyance where the imaging window might flicker briefly when restoring the window layout
Fixed a bug where when editing triggers, having a blank Matcharoo regex caused the test string to stop updating properly
Fixed a crash with aliases where a blank Matcharoo regex would crash!
Fixed a minor glitch in the Trigger/Alias test string displays being hilighted wrong with multibyte characters
Fixed a crash where if BeipMU.exe is launched by itself without a config.txt or Assets/DefaultConfig.txt it crashes at launch instead of using defaults

4.00.289 - 2019-10-13

Added /ping command to measure time from command send to server response (useful to measure network latency and server perf)
Added 'Test Text' field in the triggers dialog to allow easy testing of what the Matcharoo will match on (with regex variable hilighting too!)
Added File->'Load backup configuration...' to load the last backup configuration made (backup configs are made each time the app is updated)
Added 'History Window - Toggle' to keyboard shortcuts
Added 'Imaging Window - Toggle' to keyboard shortcuts
Fixed extra 100ms network send/receive latency issue on the store version (not sure when this started, but it's gone now)

4.00.288 - 2019-10-10

Added tab completion, just press tab to search input history/output/spawns for words to autocomplete with.
  Pressing tab after a space will suggest a next word in the same way
  You can disable this behavior by setting the 'Input Window - Autocomplete' keyboard shortcut to nothing
Fixed Alt+# display to not get stuck on after Alt+Tab/etc

4.00.287 - 2019-10-3

Added Stat Panes, shows integers, strings, or ranges to show character stats/attributes/etc. Values updated through trigger stat actions
Added 'Content restored' messages to every spawn window, along with 'Connected' and 'Disconnected' messages to make things clearer

Changed the look of the taskbar & splitter bars, tabs now drag rearrange a lot nicer now
Changed window titles to reverse the order of the items from server - character - puppet to puppet - character - server.
Improved image viewer so it doesn't use a case sensitive search for images (for example, .jpg worked, but .JPG did not)
Fixed a bug when docking windows where they would take up the entire client space, instead limit them to at most half of the space
Fixed a bug when docking windows where they could not be docked on the outside edge, they'd always go to the next inner pane
Fixed minor glitch where during Find in the output window, the scrollbar wouldn't move to match the shown text

4.00.286 - 2019-9-6

Added a dockable image viewer window that downloads and displays the last image URLs seen in the output
  Note: Dockable image viewer will automatically appear on image links unless disabled in options
Added restore of minimized/maximized state of every window (also fixes a bug where panes shrink gradually if you closed it while maximized)
Fixed regression from build 285 where new windows would always have two tabs
Fixed annoyance where if you connect from a connect dialog, a reconnected tab in a different window won't get the focus
Fixed a bug where puppets would prevent window configurations from being saved to their characters (the puppet one would overwrite it then be ignored)
Fixed annoyance where if you restore a configuration from another computer and any of the windows/panes are off screen, they are moved to the primary monitor
Improved hyperlink parsing so that a ')' at the end is included if there's an unmatched '(' before it (doesn't handle nested ('s though)
Improved Log filename %server%/%character% substitutions to allow multiple substitutions of each

4.00.285 - 2019-8-1

Spawns, input windows, and input history now have their layouts and content restored per character (and on exit/reopen)
  Bonus: If there's a crash, the content will be restored up to the moment of the crash!
Changed the welcome text into a popup window, since it doesn't fit anywhere in the restored content
Added a tooltip for the window tabs, so if they're truncated it's still possible to see the full name, unread count, etc.
Added 'Convert spaces to %B' function
Added '/autolog' to restart any stopped server/character autolog
Added '/reconnect' to reconnect to all disconnected tabs in every window

Added %server% and %character% variable substitution for all log filenames
Added right click menu for URLs (open/copy)
Added support for Pueblo <send> tags
Added Tab number display when Alt is pressed (for easy Alt+# switching)
Changed it so that the config.txt file is locked on open, so you can't open two copies that try to write to the same file accidentally
Changed '/wall <params>' to act like <params> was directly typed in every connected world. So aliases & commands all work
Changed input history color to be the window color, not the inaccessible local echo color
Changed TCP_NODELAY to be on by default since BeipMU already internally coalesces sent data into single blocks optimally
Fixed minor annoyance where clicking on a spawn window in the background wouldn't bring it's main window to the front
Fixed a crash when trying to connect with SSL and the port isn't the SSL one (basically when SSL fails to negotiate)
Improve tooltips so that they don't go off the right or bottom edges of the working area of the monitor they appear on

4.00.284 - 2019-4-25

Added Telnet CHARSET negotiation so UTF-8 encoding is enabled automatically
Added 'Clear spawn' action for spawn triggers
Added 'Gag from Log' action for spawn triggers (so a single spawn or an entire capture can be easily gagged from the log)
Added error display for trigger importing (to explain why it failed vs just 'error')
Changed 'Explorer' dialog into 'Character Statistics', and added a lot of refinements to it
Added 'Connection Count' 'Connected Time' 'Total Bytes' as character statistics

Fixed a hang (will unhang after many seconds) in find if what you're looking for doesn't exist 

4.00.282 - 2019-3-22

Enhanced Aliases to allow nested aliases without using a folder. Nested aliases only are applied if the parent alias is applied
Enhanced Alt+# handling so that Control adds 10, so Alt+Ctrl+4 = tab 14
Change relative path logging location to be the documents folder if the store app, or the config file location otherwise
Fixed a bug where ansi color settings would not carry over to the next line if a blank line is between them
Fixed a crash if you set bold, underline, strikeout, and italics at the same time (caught by output stress test, surprisingly this bug has existed forever)
Fixed a bug where closed spawn tabs were not actually closed, just made not visible in a buggy way
Fixed a crash where with the right combination of text and multiple wrapped lines, the line layout code would go out of bounds ( = instead of a += in the text index)

Added ability to export/import triggers!
Added 'Input Window - Push to History' keyboard shortcut to explicitly just push to history, similar to Ctrl+Down

Added %date% variable for log file names that uses the log date file format
Changed 'New Content' to use 'bottom' stroke style

Changed regex triggers to only color/style the ()'d areas if they are there, otherwise it uses the whole match
Changed hyperlink send triggers to turn the first ()'d area if it exists, otherwise it uses the whole match
Changed 'Stop processing if hit' to still execute child triggers just no further triggers after this
Changed 'Paragraph Spacing' so that it's centered around the text line versus at the bottom (noticeable with fan fold on)
Improved trigger dialog to disable options that have no effect, like when actions are disabled for a folder
Improved text window 'Split on page up' to merge on ctrl+end, previously only merged on page+down
Improved spawn capture triggers so that editing the Capture Until on the current capture trigger applies immediately
  Plus made it so that the trigger that starts the capture sets the end capture, not the one to open the spawn window
Improved 'Send the last line in history' to process commands (aka act exactly as it did when it was first sent)

Fixed mouse wheel scrolling to handle fractional amounts (some laptop touch pads would scroll wildly before)
Fixed bug where multiple triggers setting paragraph options wouldn't always take effect
Fixed bug where rearranging spawn tabs resulted in incorrect activity hilighting
Fixed bug where new input windows would cause tab that created them to steal focus (not fun if done through a trigger)

Fixed some Wine issues on Linux where there'd be multiple disconnect messages and an error message

3.00.278 - 2019-1-6If yo

Fixed bug where copy trigger were not copying the new cooldown values (instead it had garbage values)
Fixed new triggers/aliases/macros appearing at the right location in the list if folders are used
Fixed a hopefully rare bug where there might be a crash on shutdown due to the OS timer not being reset properly
Fixed a bug where 'Log from beginning...' would not log as html properly (bug was in the new unicode filename chooser)

Added 'Split on page up' to text window options
Added 'Description' field to triggers
Fixed a bug where spawn windows set keyboard focus to window they appear in, even if it's not the active tab

Add split views to all of the text output windows, accessible through right click & middle mouse button
Add 'Find...' right click option to Spawn windows to search for text in them

3.00.273 - 2018-9-5

Performance improvements to text layout (over 100x faster!)
 Don't reformat single lines whose width are less than the new width
 Switch to custom version of TextExtent, and run the layout across all CPU cores
 Raised the default history limit from 1,000 to 10,000 lines (though even 100,000 or more is super fast when resizing now)
Performance improvement to non regex trigger searches (2x faster)
Performance improvement in receiving new text
 Helped by above improvments, but profiles showed that a lot of time was spend updating the scrollbars. Now they update once instead of per line.
Fixed a regression from the previous build where the emoji tip of the day was not showing colorized emojis
Fixed Help->Contents... link to point to Github and not the old Reddit wiki

Fixed an infinite recursion bug with 'MUD Prompts' and a send trigger (the prompt fake a receive, which can cause a send trigger, that leads to another receive, etc)
Fixed a crash on shutdown if a toast window was dismissed

Added app.configpath to get the location of the config file
Modified startup script load code to make any relative path to be relative to the config file location

3.00.268

Changed the sound file selection dialog filter from *.wav to *.* since many formats are supported
Fixed a bug where if an unsupported sound file plays, it uses up a playback slot, after too many unsupported files no new sounds can play

3.00.267 - 2018-5-11

Added 'Connect at Startup' to characters
Fixed another separate spelling bug where if it's set to an invalid language, you can't select a valid one

3.00.266 - 2018-5-10

Fixed a bad regression when choosing the spell language choice in the preferences dialog. I think it broke with the big unicode switch

3.00.265 - 2018-5-6

Updated PCRE library to 8.42 (though the exe grew by 60K)
Added spawn window trigger type
Changed sound playback so that it can play more than wav, like mp3/mp4/wmv/wma/mkv/ogg/etc (if the OS can do it, BeipMU can)
  Note: To get ogg playback, you will need to install this first: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/web/9n5tdp8vcmhs?rtc=1
  Sound playback also now supports multiple sounds overlapping (artificially limited to 16)
Changed Trigger dialog appearance tab to only show colors in the preview when they're actually being applied
Changed Trigger dialog appearance tab to auto-check the fore/back color options when a color is chosen
Changed default of 'Strip trailing spaces in received text' to off as it was breaking MUD maps
Changed default of Ansi option 'Reset settings on new lines' to off as it was breaking MUD text coloring
Added VGA ansi color defaults to the Ansi presets, and renamed XP to CMD
Fixed a bug where </font> tags didn't restore font face & size, only colors
Fixed some flashing text bugs. Text with a background color wouldn't redraw, plus the first blinking tag on screen was out of sync with the rest.

3.00.264 - 2018-3-22

Changed the ReverseDNSLookup script function to Unicode
Improved the built in help for the /delay, /idle, and /log commands
Added 24-bit ansi support (see '/test ansi' for an example)

3.00.263 - 2018-2-12

3.00.262 - 2018-2-10

Fixed a crash when MUD Prompt handling is enabled and a server with MCP enabled is connected to (accidental recursion)
When opening the worlds/connection window it will now automatically select the current character/server in the tree view
Fixed a regression caused in build 261 that caused hyperlinks to not work properly (the std::thread fix missed an important step)
Fixed another regression caused in build 261 that could cause sending large puppet strings to crash (sorry Squirrelly!)

3.00.261 - 2018-2-4

The taskbar was still drawing text in a non-unicode way, so world names with unicode chars would display ugly
The time & date display code is now unicode (the yyyy-MM-dd formatting stuff)
Rewrote the timer code again (last time was in build 193) using a single OS timer plus a priority queue
Fixed a crash in the triggers dialog when clicking 'copy' while a server/character is selected.
Noticed that using std::thread was adding an extra 100+K to the build (loads of dependencies), so used my previous code

3.00.260 - Skipped, accidentally released build 259 on the store as build 260

3.00.259 - 2018-1-14

Help->Contents... now opens up the online wiki instead of looking for BeipMU.chm
Fixed bug where store version of BeipMU would look for config.txt in startup directory, now it only looks in the store %appdata% folder
Fixed a glitch where adding a comma in the middle of a word "sentence" "sent,ence" would cause the correct first part "sent" to appear misspelled
Unicode! BeipMU now uses UTF-8 for everything, so you can use emojis or foreign language text everywhere
Added an emoji substitution table so that things like "dog" and "zebra" will have the emoji appended after them without mu* UTF8/emoji support (see Options->Emoji)
Fixed bug where trigger substitution text can cause a crash when the replacement is an empty string, and it happens at the end of the line
Switched to RichEdit 4.1 for the input text, misspelled words now get a squiggly line (previously was a straight line)
Added character encodings to the server properties since not everything supports unicode/UTF8, currently have UTF8/CP-1252/CP-437
Added /rawnetwork command to show raw network data being sent & received for easier protocol debugging
Simplified the Server Settings dialog to have 'TLS (SSL)' be a checkbox
Added the option to verify TLS/SSL certificates in the server settings
HTML Logfiles - Correct UTF-8 specifier

3.00.258 - 2017-12-3

Importing the config will now completely restart BeipMU with the new config, so that the window position/startup scripts/etc all run correctly
Fixed a bug introduced in 256 where importing the config can cause a crash (the code assumed the config would never be deleted at runtime, which is no longer true)
Fixed a rare bug where the MessageBox asking if you want to delete nested triggers was not modal and could lead to a crash if it was ignored
Changed the design of the server & character duplicate names so that now there is only one name instead of two separate name fields. If anyone had a fancy name here, it is put into the Info field when updating.
Fixed an annoyance where when selecting text the tooltip window will appear and obscure what's being selected

3.00.257 - 2017-12-1

Updated defaults when there is no config file, as the existing defaults looked really bad
Fixed a bug where BeipMU can crash on closing if any message boxes appear while closing.

3.00.256 - First microsoft store release!

Changed the "Connect String" to act like it was typed into the input window, so multiple lines of commands and text is processed.
After disconnecting from a server, the ansi properties are always reset.
Added an option to puppets "Hide Receive Prefix" (default to true) so that the prefix can optionally be left visible
Rewrote how config files are handled, now %APPDATA%/BeipMU is used to store the config. If a config.txt is found in the app startup folder it is kept there, so existing users won't see a change if they update.
New Import/Export config ability
A new Edit sub-menu, "Convert". With "New lines to %R", and "Tabs to %T"
Fixed how telnet IAC + GA was handled, previously it was adding blank lines when there was no prompt text.

3.00.255 - 2017-4-23

Increased the UI font size, and changed the font to Calibri to be easier to read at all DPIs.
Fixed bug in logging where newline isn't added on sent lines (introduced in an earlier code cleanup)

3.00.254 - 2017-3-25

Fixed a bug where logging to an HTML file wouldn't write the HTML header when creating a new file
Improved the history text selection when auto adjust height is on, so more than the last line of text is shown
Fixed a crash when double clicking to the right of a line of text (added in 243 with the select word feature)

3.00.253 - 2017-2-19

More high DPI fixes, taskbar icons, some fonts, and the font size display in the text window
Fixed what looks like a Windows 10 bug with the tooltips blinking in the text window. Switched to a custom implementation.

3.00.252 - 2016-7-4

Added initial high DPI support
Changed puppet autoconnect code to not use the current window if it's disconnected

2.00.128

Found out there was a CRT dll on all systems past Win95 that I could use instead of importing 30k into Imaging.dll and BeipMU.exe, so now it's dynamically loaded which saved 20k for BeipMU and reduced the imaging library by 60k.

2.00.127

Logging now includes options to log what you typed and/or what was sent to the server.
Saves the Direct Connect info in the connect dialog.
Adjusted the font style used to measure text, fixing an underline dreg in Courier New 9pt

Fixed image receiving code.  Stupid bug.
Added ansi codes: 2, 7, 22, 24, 25, 27 (dim, reverse, and unset-flags), handle [;;m empty codes


2.00.121

Mav and I figured out the strange crash when viewing /help then doing a few things.  Turns out it was me passing in a negative length to GDI which caused a crash on Win9x.  NT handled it fine.

Made it so that when viewing scrollback, new lines do not cause it to jump to the bottom, as per Revar's guidelines.

2.00.117

Added a reverse DNS lookup command in the app interface to help with the sockets.

Added the ISocket and ISocketServer interfaces, so that outgoing connections and simple servers can be done in a few lines of script!

2.00.115

Added 'Reconnect' to the Connect menu for easy access and discoverability, rather than finding out by trying to send something once you're already disconnected.

2.00.114

Fixed the bug where switching windows in MDI mode when all windows were maximized would cause a reformat behind the scenes (regression from blinking text causing the reformat).

Fixed a bug in the new 'Last IP' field where a crash might result on a failed DNS lookup due to attempting to access the undefined hostinfo structure.

2.00.113

Added a debug output window for scripts.  Script errors are sent here instead of through a popup window, and scripts can output their own debug messages through app.OutputDebugHTML(string), and app.OutputDebugText(string).

2.00.111

Added '/logall' that does the same thing as 'Starting from the beginning...' under the logging menu.

Added a 'Last IP' field for every server that remembers the last DNS lookup so that in case the DNS lookup fails, it will fall back to the last looked up IP.

/Tracert and /Ping will now work on the current server if you're connected, and if a current tracert or ping is in progress they will abort it.
Fixed a minor issue in tracert where it waits unnecessarily, lowering performance.

2.00.110

SSL connection spam would appear with <$color> tags as it was displaying text incorrectly (and becoming dependant on the HTML tag parsing flag in the world settings)
Text wrapping - Lines with carriage returns would incorrectly wrap on the last word before the carriage return.
/test ansi - Caused a crash since the code assumed there was a server during the test

2.00.109

MDI: Edit menu was being left disabled after closing all windows and opening a new one.  Bug caused because MDI is sneaky.

Fixed the hang in the Trigger dialog when clicking on away/present

2.00.108

Fixed SSL issue that only surfaced on Windows 9X where it'd hang on an error
Fixed another SSL issue where on Windows 9X connections after the first are broken due to having the same SPN value as the original (basically only the first SSL connection on win9x worked well, after that it was luck).

2.00.107

Fixed crash at midnight when you're autologging with date
Fixed crash in the multiple retry code if you're unlucky

Fixed connection still showing as connected in the multiple retry code due to me forgetting to have it say 'yea, I'm really disconnected now' though this was purely cosmetic.

Reworked the event system to support multiple event hooks natively (and broke Squirrelly's scripts temporarily)

Beautified the network error codes a bit (don't know how I lived without those).
 
Pre 2.00.0107

 SSL Support (added a new server type in the connect dialog)
 Network connect/disconnect errors are now reported properly
 New log file created at midnight when auto logging with date appended
 Splitters in main window move nicer and smoother

 Keyboard Shortcuts now have 'don't care' options on modifier keys so that you can say 'Key is Ctrl+K and I don't care if shift is down or not'
 Some Ansi handling bugs
 Option to not reset ansi colors on new lines
 MDI mode bug fix where switching windows slowed down when more text was in the window, caused by a hidden window resize that did a hidden reformat of all the text (ouch)
