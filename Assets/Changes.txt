3.00.271

Fixed some Tilemap error checking, now tileSize and mapSize are validated (can crash if they're omitted)
Fixed an infinite recursion bug with 'MUD Prompts' and a send trigger (the prompt fake a receive, which can cause a send trigger, that leads to another receive, etc)
Fixed a crash on shutdown if a toast window was dismissed
Worked around a weird input box issue where FixedSys doesn't get set until you first type some text. Only for that font, so some odd bug in Windows.
Added app.PlaySound(filename, volume=1.0) and app.StopSounds() script functions to enable playing sounds.
Added app.configpath to get the location of the config file
Modified startup script load code to make any relative path to be relative to the config file location
Added 'BeipMU updated' message on startup

Added Folders for Triggers and Aliases, through a 'Treat as Folder' option
Improved emoji rendering so that they flash if in flashing text
Changed the spawn windows to support regex \1 \2 style match replacement
Fixed unclickable hyperlinks in spawn windows, now they work the same as in the main window
Added .Active property to ITimer interface
Honor WM_ENDSESSION and don't show any dialogs when the app is shutting down (otherwise when windows is shutting down, BeipMU looks like it hangs when it has a dialog up)
Added <tilemap> tag handling (see https://github.com/BeipDev/BeipMU/blob/master/TileMap.md for more info)

3.00.268

Changed the sound file selection dialog filter from *.wav to *.* since many formats are supported
Fixed a bug where if an unsupported sound file plays, it uses up a playback slot, after too many unsupported files no new sounds can play
A couple minor fixes so that it runs in Windows 10 mode on Wine (it called functions that exist on Windows 10, but not on Wine set to Windows 10)

3.00.267

Added 'Connect at Startup' to characters
Fixed another separate spelling bug where if it's set to an invalid language, you can't select a valid one

3.00.266

Fixed a bad regression when choosing the spell language choice in the preferences dialog. I think it broke with the big unicode switch

3.00.265

Updated PCRE library to 8.42 (though the exe grew by 60K)
Added spawn window trigger type
Changed sound playback so that it can play more than wav, like mp3/mp4/wmv/wma/mkv/ogg/etc (if the OS can do it, BeipMU can)
  Note: To get ogg playback, you will need to install this first: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/web/9n5tdp8vcmhs?rtc=1
  Sound playback also now supports multiple sounds overlapping (artificially limited to 16)
Changed Trigger dialog appearance tab to only show colors in the preview when they're actually being applied
Changed Trigger dialog appearance tab to auto-check the fore/back color options when a color is chosen
Changed default of 'Strip trailing spaces in received text' to off as it was breaking MUD maps
Changed default of Ansi option 'Reset settings on new lines' to off as it was breaking MUD text coloring
Added VGA ansi color defaults to the Ansi presets, and renamed XP to CMD
Fixed a bug where </font> tags didn't restore font face & size, only colors
Fixed some flashing text bugs. Text with a background color wouldn't redraw, plus the first blinking tag on screen was out of sync with the rest.
Fixed the tooltips in the bottom button bar, looks like they broke on the switch to Unicode

3.00.264

Changed the ReverseDNSLookup script function to Unicode
Improved the built in help for the /delay, /idle, and /log commands
Added 24-bit ansi support (see '/test ansi' for an example)

Fixed a couple of regressions from the timer code rewritten in 261. One was that all timer based events would stop, another was the blinking activity notify didn't blink.

3.00.262

Fixed a crash when MUD Prompt handling is enabled and a server with MCP enabled is connected to (accidental recursion)
When opening the worlds/connection window it will now automatically select the current character/server in the tree view
Fixed a regression caused in build 261 that caused hyperlinks to not work properly (the std::thread fix missed an important step)
Fixed another regression caused in build 261 that could cause sending large puppet strings to crash (sorry Squirrelly!)

3.00.261

The taskbar was still drawing text in a non-unicode way, so world names with unicode chars would display ugly
The time & date display code is now unicode (the yyyy-MM-dd formatting stuff)
Rewrote the timer code again (last time was in build 193) using a single OS timer plus a priority queue
Fixed a crash in the triggers dialog when clicking 'copy' while a server/character is selected.
Noticed that using std::thread was adding an extra 100+K to the build (loads of dependencies), so used my previous code

3.00.260 - Skipped, accidentally released build 259 on the store as build 260

3.00.259

Help->Contents... now opens up the online wiki instead of looking for BeipMU.chm
Fixed bug where store version of BeipMU would look for config.txt in startup directory, now it only looks in the store %appdata% folder
Fixed a glitch where adding a comma in the middle of a word "sentence" "sent,ence" would cause the correct first part "sent" to appear misspelled
Unicode! BeipMU now uses UTF-8 for everything, so you can use emojis or foreign language text everywhere
Added an emoji substitution table so that things like "dog" and "zebra" will have the emoji appended after them without mu* UTF8/emoji support (see Options->Emoji)
Fixed bug where trigger substitution text can cause a crash when the replacement is an empty string, and it happens at the end of the line
Switched to RichEdit 4.1 for the input text, misspelled words now get a squiggly line (previously was a straight line)
Added character encodings to the server properties since not everything supports unicode/UTF8, currently have UTF8/CP-1252/CP-437
Added /rawnetwork command to show raw network data being sent & received for easier protocol debugging
Simplified the Server Settings dialog to have 'TLS (SSL)' be a checkbox
Added the option to verify TLS/SSL certificates in the server settings
HTML Logfiles - Correct UTF-8 specifier

3.00.258

Importing the config will now completely restart BeipMU with the new config, so that the window position/startup scripts/etc all run correctly
Fixed a bug introduced in 256 where importing the config can cause a crash (the code assumed the config would never be deleted at runtime, which is no longer true)
Fixed a rare bug where the MessageBox asking if you want to delete nested triggers was not modal and could lead to a crash if it was ignored
Changed the design of the server & character duplicate names so that now there is only one name instead of two separate name fields. If anyone had a fancy name here, it is put into the Info field when updating.
Fixed an annoyance where when selecting text the tooltip window will appear and obscure what's being selected

3.00.257

Updated defaults when there is no config file, as the existing defaults looked really bad
Fixed a bug where BeipMU can crash on closing if any message boxes appear while closing.

3.00.256 - First microsoft store release!

Changed the "Connect String" to act like it was typed into the input window, so multiple lines of commands and text is processed.
After disconnecting from a server, the ansi properties are always reset.
Added an option to puppets "Hide Receive Prefix" (default to true) so that the prefix can optionally be left visible
Rewrote how config files are handled, now %APPDATA%/BeipMU is used to store the config. If a config.txt is found in the app startup folder it is kept there, so existing users won't see a change if they update.
New Import/Export config ability
A new Edit sub-menu, "Convert". With "New lines to %R", and "Tabs to %T"
Fixed how telnet IAC + GA was handled, previously it was adding blank lines when there was no prompt text.

3.00.255

3.00.253

More high DPI fixes, taskbar icons, some fonts, and the font size display in the text window

Added 'Copy' feature to triggers pane
Fixed a bug in smart paste where the last line wasn't being sent
Simplified the puppet prefix detection code

Fixed a bug where the maximum lines in the text windows wasn't being honored (introduced in 247)

3.00.247

Changed the text window to use the new Variant type to hold text records, plus a bunch of other code cleanups in the text window
Brought back saving of input & history window sizes (only applies to input window if auto sizing is disabled)

Fixed a crash in the App.NewWindow_Text(x,y) script command due to forgetting to set a default font.
Fixed a bug in the prompt code which would result in multiple prompts
Fixed a regression caused in 243 where retrying a failed connect broke
Fixed a bug in logging where word wrapping wasn't done correctly
Fixed it where any data sent during connecting now gets sent (previously it would get into an invalid state)
Also changed the networking code to not use IO completion ports, now it's thread pool wait objects

3.00.244

Fixed bug where creating new daily logs at midnight was broken (it just didn't happen)
Fixed bug where main window title was set to previously connected world instead of current one

Worked around a Unix Wine issue where text is black/wrong size at certain times in the RichEdit input control
Changed booting without a configuration file to not show an error when you exit

3.00.243

Changed double click on text to select whole words (previously was broken and did nothing useful)
Fixed a couple mouse/prompt bugs that only happen if you clear the output window
Fixed a minor text scroll issue when making the window bigger (would let you grow past the top, then allow scrolling down)
Fixed an issue where a network error would leave the connection in a perpetual 'trying to reconnect' state that doesn't reconnect
Fixed a bug in SSL where if you send more than 16K in one line it screws up and sends the encrypted data as though that is what you typed
Fixed a performance issue where sending multiple lines at once would be sent as individual lines instead of being batched into one send (worse for SSL)

Direct Connect/Regular Connect/Quick Connect now share the same logic of 'reuse disconnected world' else 'use current window' else 'search for never connected window' else 'create new window'
/@ command to run immediate scripts was broken (it forgot to strip the /@ out, so the scripting engine would get confused)

Made Ctrl-'+' be ignored when typing in the input window

3.00.238

Added a character counter to count the number of letters typed into the input window.
Fixed config file bug, where array type items (keys & colors) were relying on undefined behavior and crashing.

3.00.231

Fixed the SSL bug thanks to Shiveneve! The trailing encryption buffer changes size after encryption, who knew?

3.00.230

Made the mouse wheel scroll amount match the system setting instead of being hardcoded to two.
Removed my SSL hack since now it seems to be breaking Windows 8.1 users.

2.00.128

Found out there was a CRT dll on all systems past Win95 that I could use instead of importing 30k into Imaging.dll and BeipMU.exe, so now it's dynamically loaded which saved 20k for BeipMU and reduced the imaging library by 60k.

2.00.127

Logging now includes options to log what you typed and/or what was sent to the server.
Saves the Direct Connect info in the connect dialog.
Adjusted the font style used to measure text, fixing an underline dreg in Courier New 9pt

2.00.126

Fixed Thygrrr's 16-bit scroll bar limit.  Uses the 32-bit windows api now (instead of the 16-bit message)

Improved internal event system (spurred by VB's requirements)
Object Model: Added Connection object + events

2.00.123

Made it so that when dialogs are reactivated the focus returns to the control who had it when the dialog was deactivated.  It's standard behavior and I just wasn't doing it.

Fixed image receiving code.  Stupid bug.
Added ansi codes: 2, 7, 22, 24, 25, 27 (dim, reverse, and unset-flags), handle [;;m empty codes


2.00.121

Mav and I figured out the strange crash when viewing /help then doing a few things.  Turns out it was me passing in a negative length to GDI which caused a crash on Win9x.  NT handled it fine.

2.00.119

Fixed Sabbath's Text Layout Bug
Made it so that when viewing scrollback, new lines do not cause it to jump to the bottom, as per Revar's guidelines.
Added a Last Used time and a created time in the characters.
Fixed the weird 'cursor moved after going back to window' problem.  Squirrelly and I magically figured that one out.

Added a forward DNS lookup command
Added an IsAddress command to return true if the string passed is a valid IP address

2.00.117

Added a reverse DNS lookup command in the app interface to help with the sockets.

2.00.116

Added the ISocket and ISocketServer interfaces, so that outgoing connections and simple servers can be done in a few lines of script!

2.00.0115

Added 'Reconnect' to the Connect menu for easy access and discoverability, rather than finding out by trying to send something once you're already disconnected.

2.00.0114

Fixed the bug where switching windows in MDI mode when all windows were maximized would cause a reformat behind the scenes (regression from blinking text causing the reformat).

Fixed a bug in the new 'Last IP' field where a crash might result on a failed DNS lookup due to attempting to access the undefined hostinfo structure.

2.00.0113

Added a debug output window for scripts.  Script errors are sent here instead of through a popup window, and scripts can output their own debug messages through app.OutputDebugHTML(string), and app.OutputDebugText(string).

2.00.0111

Added '/logall' that does the same thing as 'Starting from the beginning...' under the logging menu.

Added a 'Last IP' field for every server that remembers the last DNS lookup so that in case the DNS lookup fails, it will fall back to the last looked up IP.

/Tracert and /Ping will now work on the current server if you're connected, and if a current tracert or ping is in progress they will abort it.
Fixed a minor issue in tracert where it waits unnecessarily, lowering performance.

2.00.0110

SSL connection spam would appear with <$color> tags as it was displaying text incorrectly (and becoming dependant on the HTML tag parsing flag in the world settings)
Text wrapping - Lines with carriage returns would incorrectly wrap on the last word before the carriage return.
/test ansi - Caused a crash since the code assumed there was a server during the test

2.00.0109

MDI: Edit menu was being left disabled after closing all windows and opening a new one.  Bug caused because MDI is sneaky.

Fixed the hang in the Trigger dialog when clicking on away/present

2.00.0108

Fixed SSL issue that only surfaced on Windows 9X where it'd hang on an error
Fixed another SSL issue where on Windows 9X connections after the first are broken due to having the same SPN value as the original (basically only the first SSL connection on win9x worked well, after that it was luck).

2.00.0107

Fixed crash at midnight when you're autologging with date
Fixed crash in the multiple retry code if you're unlucky

Fixed connection still showing as connected in the multiple retry code due to me forgetting to have it say 'yea, I'm really disconnected now' though this was purely cosmetic.

Reworked the event system to support multiple event hooks natively (and broke Squirrelly's scripts temporarily)

Beautified the network error codes a bit (don't know how I lived without those).
 
Pre 2.00.0107

 SSL Support (added a new server type in the connect dialog)
 Network connect/disconnect errors are now reported properly
 New log file created at midnight when auto logging with date appended
 Splitters in main window move nicer and smoother
 Smart Paste now shows what's in the clipboard and the number of bytes it will take
 Keyboard Shortcuts now have 'don't care' options on modifier keys so that you can say 'Key is Ctrl+K and I don't care if shift is down or not'
 Some Ansi handling bugs
 Option to not reset ansi colors on new lines
 MDI mode bug fix where switching windows slowed down when more text was in the window, caused by a hidden window resize that did a hidden reformat of all the text (ouch)

 Puppet Auto Logging
 Auto Connecting Puppets
 ActiveScripting support (VB & Java) see scripting.txt for more info
