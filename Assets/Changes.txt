Changed inline images to decode on a background thread vs the UI thread, should be a little smoother
Improved HTML logging to handle paragraph styles, toggle-able time stamps and formatting!

Changed Log file picker to remember the file extension after closing it
Changed puppets to not see the Connected/Disconnected messages as it'd cause activity in their windows that wasn't useful
Switched to PCRE 10.34 (from PCRE 8.x, exe grew by about 100k so hopefully regexes works a lot better!)

Fixed hang/crash bug with the find dialog that happens if you have a 'New Content' marker visible, the output window is at maximum, and new text comes in
Fixed a hang when || is in a regex (probably mid edit due to preview). 'a||b' is seen as 'a or nothing or b' and the nothing results in an infinite loop of nothing matches.

Added 'Set Background Color' option to stat windows
Added Logging->'Starting From Top of Window...' menu item to start a log from anywhere in the output history

Fixed spawn tab triggers to now honor the "Don't show as activity" setting
Fixed a bug in smart paste where it was adding an extra line feed per line, resulting in LF CR LF sequences instead of the correct CR LF.
Fixed the tiny drag image in the Worlds dialog, same issue that the trigger/macros/aliases had when dragging an image, forgot to fix this one too
Fixed a hang when sending enormous blocks of text (>64K) and using restore logs (if what is sent is larger than the restore log size it would get stuck trying to make room forever)

Fixed a minor annoyance where the imaging window might flicker briefly when restoring the window layout
Fixed a bug where when editing triggers, having a blank Matcharoo regex caused the test string to stop updating properly
Fixed a crash with aliases where a blank Matcharoo regex would crash!
Fixed a minor glitch in the Trigger/Alias test string displays being hilighted wrong with multibyte characters
Fixed a crash where if BeipMU.exe is launched by itself without a config.txt or Assets/DefaultConfig.txt it crashes at launch instead of using defaults

4.00.289 - 2019-10-13

Added /ping command to measure time from command send to server response (useful to measure network latency and server perf)

Changed the look of the taskbar & splitter bars, tabs now drag rearrange a lot nicer now
Changed window titles to reverse the order of the items from server - character - puppet to puppet - character - server.
Improved image viewer so it doesn't use a case sensitive search for images (for example, .jpg worked, but .JPG did not)
Fixed a bug when docking windows where they would take up the entire client space, instead limit them to at most half of the space
Fixed a bug when docking windows where they could not be docked on the outside edge, they'd always go to the next inner pane

Fixed annoyance where if you restore a configuration from another computer and any of the windows/panes are off screen, they are moved to the primary monitor
Improved hyperlink parsing so that a ')' at the end is included if there's an unmatched '(' before it (doesn't handle nested ('s though)
Improved Log filename %server%/%character% substitutions to allow multiple substitutions of each

4.00.285 - 2019-8-1

Spawns, input windows, and input history now have their layouts and content restored per character (and on exit/reopen)
  Bonus: If there's a crash, the content will be restored up to the moment of the crash!

Added right click menu for URLs (open/copy)
Added support for Pueblo <send> tags
Added Tab number display when Alt is pressed (for easy Alt+# switching)
Changed it so that the config.txt file is locked on open, so you can't open two copies that try to write to the same file accidentally
Changed '/wall <params>' to act like <params> was directly typed in every connected world. So aliases & commands all work
Changed input history color to be the window color, not the inaccessible local echo color
Changed TCP_NODELAY to be on by default since BeipMU already internally coalesces sent data into single blocks optimally
Fixed minor annoyance where clicking on a spawn window in the background wouldn't bring it's main window to the front

Fixed bug where multiple triggers setting paragraph options wouldn't always take effect
Fixed bug where rearranging spawn tabs resulted in incorrect activity hilighting
Fixed bug where new input windows would cause tab that created them to steal focus (not fun if done through a trigger)

Add 'Find...' right click option to Spawn windows to search for text in them

 Don't reformat single lines whose width are less than the new width
 Switch to custom version of TextExtent, and run the layout across all CPU cores
 Raised the default history limit from 1,000 to 10,000 lines (though even 100,000 or more is super fast when resizing now)
Performance improvement to non regex trigger searches (2x faster)
Performance improvement in receiving new text

3.00.268

Changed the sound file selection dialog filter from *.wav to *.* since many formats are supported
Fixed a bug where if an unsupported sound file plays, it uses up a playback slot, after too many unsupported files no new sounds can play

Fixed another separate spelling bug where if it's set to an invalid language, you can't select a valid one

3.00.265 - 2018-5-6

Updated PCRE library to 8.42 (though the exe grew by 60K)
Added spawn window trigger type
Changed sound playback so that it can play more than wav, like mp3/mp4/wmv/wma/mkv/ogg/etc (if the OS can do it, BeipMU can)
  Note: To get ogg playback, you will need to install this first: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/web/9n5tdp8vcmhs?rtc=1
  Sound playback also now supports multiple sounds overlapping (artificially limited to 16)
Changed Trigger dialog appearance tab to only show colors in the preview when they're actually being applied
Changed Trigger dialog appearance tab to auto-check the fore/back color options when a color is chosen

Changed default of Ansi option 'Reset settings on new lines' to off as it was breaking MUD text coloring
Added VGA ansi color defaults to the Ansi presets, and renamed XP to CMD
Fixed a bug where </font> tags didn't restore font face & size, only colors
Fixed some flashing text bugs. Text with a background color wouldn't redraw, plus the first blinking tag on screen was out of sync with the rest.

3.00.262 - 2018-2-10

Fixed a crash when MUD Prompt handling is enabled and a server with MCP enabled is connected to (accidental recursion)
When opening the worlds/connection window it will now automatically select the current character/server in the tree view
Fixed a regression caused in build 261 that caused hyperlinks to not work properly (the std::thread fix missed an important step)
Fixed another regression caused in build 261 that could cause sending large puppet strings to crash (sorry Squirrelly!)

3.00.261 - 2018-2-4

The taskbar was still drawing text in a non-unicode way, so world names with unicode chars would display ugly
The time & date display code is now unicode (the yyyy-MM-dd formatting stuff)
Rewrote the timer code again (last time was in build 193) using a single OS timer plus a priority queue
Fixed a crash in the triggers dialog when clicking 'copy' while a server/character is selected.
Noticed that using std::thread was adding an extra 100+K to the build (loads of dependencies), so used my previous code

3.00.260 - Skipped, accidentally released build 259 on the store as build 260

3.00.259 - 2018-1-14

Help->Contents... now opens up the online wiki instead of looking for BeipMU.chm
Fixed bug where store version of BeipMU would look for config.txt in startup directory, now it only looks in the store %appdata% folder
Fixed a glitch where adding a comma in the middle of a word "sentence" "sent,ence" would cause the correct first part "sent" to appear misspelled
Unicode! BeipMU now uses UTF-8 for everything, so you can use emojis or foreign language text everywhere
Added an emoji substitution table so that things like "dog" and "zebra" will have the emoji appended after them without mu* UTF8/emoji support (see Options->Emoji)
Fixed bug where trigger substitution text can cause a crash when the replacement is an empty string, and it happens at the end of the line
Switched to RichEdit 4.1 for the input text, misspelled words now get a squiggly line (previously was a straight line)

Simplified the Server Settings dialog to have 'TLS (SSL)' be a checkbox
Added the option to verify TLS/SSL certificates in the server settings
HTML Logfiles - Correct UTF-8 specifier

Importing the config will now completely restart BeipMU with the new config, so that the window position/startup scripts/etc all run correctly
Fixed a bug introduced in 256 where importing the config can cause a crash (the code assumed the config would never be deleted at runtime, which is no longer true)
Fixed a rare bug where the MessageBox asking if you want to delete nested triggers was not modal and could lead to a crash if it was ignored
Changed the design of the server & character duplicate names so that now there is only one name instead of two separate name fields. If anyone had a fancy name here, it is put into the Info field when updating.
Fixed an annoyance where when selecting text the tooltip window will appear and obscure what's being selected

3.00.257 - 2017-12-1

Updated defaults when there is no config file, as the existing defaults looked really bad
Fixed a bug where BeipMU can crash on closing if any message boxes appear while closing.

3.00.256 - First microsoft store release!

Changed the "Connect String" to act like it was typed into the input window, so multiple lines of commands and text is processed.
After disconnecting from a server, the ansi properties are always reset.
Added an option to puppets "Hide Receive Prefix" (default to true) so that the prefix can optionally be left visible
Rewrote how config files are handled, now %APPDATA%/BeipMU is used to store the config. If a config.txt is found in the app startup folder it is kept there, so existing users won't see a change if they update.
New Import/Export config ability
A new Edit sub-menu, "Convert". With "New lines to %R", and "Tabs to %T"
Fixed how telnet IAC + GA was handled, previously it was adding blank lines when there was no prompt text.

Increased the UI font size, and changed the font to Calibri to be easier to read at all DPIs.
Fixed bug in logging where newline isn't added on sent lines (introduced in an earlier code cleanup)

3.00.254 - 2017-3-25

Fixed a bug where the maximum lines in the text windows wasn't being honored (introduced in 247)

3.00.247 - 2016-2-16

Rewrote the trigger/characters/keyboard macros code to be shared and fixed some inconsistencies with them along the way
Fixed a crash in the App.NewWindow_Text(x,y) script command due to forgetting to set a default font.

Fixed a minor text scroll issue when making the window bigger (would let you grow past the top, then allow scrolling down)
Fixed an issue where a network error would leave the connection in a perpetual 'trying to reconnect' state that doesn't reconnect
Fixed a bug in SSL where if you send more than 16K in one line it screws up and sends the encrypted data as though that is what you typed
Fixed a performance issue where sending multiple lines at once would be sent as individual lines instead of being batched into one send (worse for SSL)

Grayed out window tab text didn't match the connected text.
Direct Connect/Regular Connect/Quick Connect now share the same logic of 'reuse disconnected world' else 'use current window' else 'search for never connected window' else 'create new window'
/@ command to run immediate scripts was broken (it forgot to strip the /@ out, so the scripting engine would get confused)

2.00.128

Found out there was a CRT dll on all systems past Win95 that I could use instead of importing 30k into Imaging.dll and BeipMU.exe, so now it's dynamically loaded which saved 20k for BeipMU and reduced the imaging library by 60k.

2.00.127 - 2002-9-10

Logging now includes options to log what you typed and/or what was sent to the server.

Object Model: Added Connection object + events

2.00.123 - 2002-8-12

Made Alt+0 activate window 10 (used to only work from Alt+1 to Alt+9)
Fixed image receiving code.  Stupid bug.
Added ansi codes: 2, 7, 22, 24, 25, 27 (dim, reverse, and unset-flags), handle [;;m empty codes

2.00.122 - 2002-8-6

2.00.121 - 2002-7-22

Mav and I figured out the strange crash when viewing /help then doing a few things.  Turns out it was me passing in a negative length to GDI which caused a crash on Win9x.  NT handled it fine.

2.00.119 - 2002-7-17

Fixed Sabbath's Text Layout Bug
Made it so that when viewing scrollback, new lines do not cause it to jump to the bottom, as per Revar's guidelines.
Added a Last Used time and a created time in the characters.

2.00.117

Added a reverse DNS lookup command in the app interface to help with the sockets.

2.00.116 - 2002-6-19

Added the ISocket and ISocketServer interfaces, so that outgoing connections and simple servers can be done in a few lines of script!

2.00.115 - 2002-6-17

Added 'Reconnect' to the Connect menu for easy access and discoverability, rather than finding out by trying to send something once you're already disconnected.

2.00.114 - 2002-6-5

Fixed the bug where switching windows in MDI mode when all windows were maximized would cause a reformat behind the scenes (regression from blinking text causing the reformat).

Fixed a bug in the new 'Last IP' field where a crash might result on a failed DNS lookup due to attempting to access the undefined hostinfo structure.

2.00.113 - 2002-5-5

Added a debug output window for scripts.  Script errors are sent here instead of through a popup window, and scripts can output their own debug messages through app.OutputDebugHTML(string), and app.OutputDebugText(string).

2.00.111

Added '/logall' that does the same thing as 'Starting from the beginning...' under the logging menu.

Added a 'Last IP' field for every server that remembers the last DNS lookup so that in case the DNS lookup fails, it will fall back to the last looked up IP.

/Tracert and /Ping will now work on the current server if you're connected, and if a current tracert or ping is in progress they will abort it.
Fixed a minor issue in tracert where it waits unnecessarily, lowering performance.

2.00.110 - 2002-4-16

SSL connection spam would appear with <$color> tags as it was displaying text incorrectly (and becoming dependant on the HTML tag parsing flag in the world settings)
Text wrapping - Lines with carriage returns would incorrectly wrap on the last word before the carriage return.
/test ansi - Caused a crash since the code assumed there was a server during the test

2.00.109 - 2002-4-14

MDI: Edit menu was being left disabled after closing all windows and opening a new one.  Bug caused because MDI is sneaky.

Fixed the hang in the Trigger dialog when clicking on away/present

2.00.108 - 2002-4-12

Fixed SSL issue that only surfaced on Windows 9X where it'd hang on an error
Fixed another SSL issue where on Windows 9X connections after the first are broken due to having the same SPN value as the original (basically only the first SSL connection on win9x worked well, after that it was luck).

2.00.107 - 2002-3-27

Fixed crash at midnight when you're autologging with date
Fixed crash in the multiple retry code if you're unlucky

Fixed connection still showing as connected in the multiple retry code due to me forgetting to have it say 'yea, I'm really disconnected now' though this was purely cosmetic.

Reworked the event system to support multiple event hooks natively (and broke Squirrelly's scripts temporarily)

Beautified the network error codes a bit (don't know how I lived without those).

2.00.106 - 2002-3-25
2.00.105 - 2002-3-22

Some Ansi handling bugs
Option to not reset ansi colors on new lines
MDI mode bug fix where switching windows slowed down when more text was in the window, caused by a hidden window resize that did a hidden reformat of all the text (ouch)
