To create an exit to a room on a different map, right click the room and choose 'Set as exit target room' then go to the other map and right click on the destination room and say 'Create exit to room'. Exit endpoints can be attached to other rooms and also the edges of a room (to make the routes look nicer).

To route exits around things, just select an exit by clicking, then right click somewhere on the line and 'add point'. You can delete existing points by right clicking on them and choosing 'delete point'.
