Welcome to the land of BeipMU!


BeipMU was started way back in 1998 on a whim to see if I could find a way to add some simple graphics to a Muck.  The initial tests were crude and only meant to demonstrate how graphics could be done without changing the server at all.  I sent out the client to a few people so they could see the graphical demos and they recommended I add a few basic features so that it'd be easier to try out.  Gradually more and more features were added and it started to turn into a challenge to see how far we could go.

Once I had the basic functionality working, a few others joined the team, set up a web site and drew up some cool graphics.  Our advertising was basically word of mouth and as BeipMU is free to use and small to download a few more people started to give it a shot.  We gained a few more great contributors along the way, mainly people with great ideas that just needed someone who was aching to turn them into reality.

Today we're still trying to add all the requests and cool ideas people send us. So if you have anything you don't like, or ideas you'd like to see us use, send them our way!  We respond to every request!
