# Known glitches

Most everything works well, but here are a couple of known glitches.

* The burger menu on the far left of the taskbar is invisible (Direct2D font substitution doesn't work fully on Wine)
  * You can still access the menu by clicking where it should be or by tapping 'Alt' (option key on Mac)
